    LabeledShape
        Shape
            LinePartition (dict)        as attribute: line_part; module: rename
                Colineation             as attribute: lines (list)
                    Line
        LPointPartition (dict)          as attribute: lpoint_part; module: rename
            Colabeling                  as attribute: lpoint_specs (set)
                LabeledPoint
                    Point

### ElementCell class
#   2013-12-10
    Analogous methods from SGColumn and SGColabeling:
        __init__()                      __init__()
        collinear()                     colabeled()
        get_maximal_lines_from()        (set.add())
        maximal()                       (set)
        __str__()                       __str__()
        listing()                       listing()
    But this doesn't seem like enough to justify creating a parent class.
    Conclusion: abandon ElementCell.

### Colabeling
#   2013-12-10
    Why implement the collection as a set of lpoint specs
    1.  As a set of LabeledPoint objects. Problem: a set does not use an 
        element's __eq__ method
    2.  As a list of lpoints. Problem: have to implement equivalent methods to
        set methods
    3.  As a set of lpoint specs. Problem: have to unpack and repack lpoints

    Implement __add__()?

    Repair controller before finishing with __sub__?

    Colabeling. Rename lpoint_list and lpoint_spec_set? #### Yes, do this!

    __init__() should accept the same types as its attributes? Then use factory 
    class methods for other types of arguments. E.g., 
        Colabeling.__init__(self, lpoint_spec_set), not 
        Colabeling.__init__(self, lpoint_list)
    This might reduce the number of conversions.
